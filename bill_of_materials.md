Slot 8 Support Bill of Materials
--------------------------------

Below is the Bill of Materials for the Slot 8 Support board:

```
Ref(s)      Value                               Mouser P/N
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
U1          74LS33                              595-SN74LS33DR
R1, R2      10K 1206 SMD resistor               588-AS12J1002ET
C1          0.1uF 50V 1206 SMD MLC capacitor    80-C1206104K5RAC7867            
```

Parts Kits
----------

Parts kits including the PC board are available from [The Glitch Works](http://www.glitchwrks.com/xt-ide) for $5 USD + shipping. Some substitutions will be made for the above list. The kit is a complete parts kit and includes everything you need to build a Slot 8 Support -- you supply the solder and tools.

Substitutions
-------------

All resistors and capacitors are 1206 body SMD components. U1 is SOIC.

R1, R2 are pull-up resistors, their values are noncritical. Anything from 2.2K - 47K should be fine.
C1 is power supply bypass, 0.01 - 0.1 uF is fine.
